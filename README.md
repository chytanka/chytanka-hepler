# Chytanka Linker Extension

This browser extension adds a convenient **"View in Chytanka"** button next to supported links on various websites.

Supported sites:
- [mangadex.org](https://mangadex.org)

The button redirects the user to [Chytanka](https://chytanka.ink), a clean, reader-focused interface for manga and comics.

## Features

- Adds a ðŸ“– button with localized text (Ukrainian and English).
- Works dynamically with content that loads after page load (via MutationObserver).
- Lightweight, fast, and unobtrusive.

## How it works
